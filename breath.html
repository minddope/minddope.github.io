              <h3>When breathing becomes your favourite thing</h3>
              <p>
                Breathing is the most natural activity and, by default, we do not think about it too much. However, even if we do not focus our daily attention on it, every person would agree that there is no life without breathing. The whole world breathes in various forms. Recently the scientists discovered a multicellular organism which does not need the oxygen and it it still alive, but… Breathing and gas exchange process in general are the essence of life.

                Last year I made friends with my breath. The first and the most important thing is that we really discovered each other after 34 years of existing together in one body, like two tenants in one apartment who keep being strangers even if they share the same space. I started to work with my breath in a more conscious way, not only at yoga level, but in my everyday life as well.

                This slogan itself — „conscious breathing” — is one o of the most used yoga labels. We talk about it a lot, but for yoga practitioners it can remain a mistery for a long time. Last year I became conscious of the fact that neither complicated practices nor exercices change our breath. The first step to do this is the acceptance of the breath as it is produced by our organism. I stopped fighting with my body, because a good breath is natural, unforced and non-aggressive. It is an integral part of me. It opens instead of closing. If we put any lenght or depth requirements for our breath, it won’t work. It will close up the chest and abdomen, clutch the throat and it won’t fulfill its role to open the body, mind and heart. It will be just one more restriction. It is quite ridiculous to create criteria for such natural activity like breathing.

              <p>
                A breath which is not aiming any goal, which is the goal itself, will open the body slowly and calmly, and will brighten the mind. It will stretch the spine and intercostal muscles, stimulate digestive system, relax the abdomen. It will give more space where we are not expecting it. This space is tangible, physical, and it relieves the body at muscle and fascia level. This space is psychological too, like big calm which we feel inside after morning pranayama, when we open the eyes and see that the world has changed. The colours are brighter, our eyes see clearly, the feeling of sleepnes evaporates from our bodies like water from the soil after rain. Watchful, conscious, calm breath is like a shower for the body and soul. When it becomes the favorite thing, the life begins anew.
